iPropose Treasure Hunt
======================

I used this GPS based iPhone application to propose to my fiancee in 2012. This was my
first experience writing a (relatively) large program for iOS. It used some of the new
features then available only on the iPhone 4, like Automatic Reference Counting.

I have to say, it ended up working fairly well because we're engaged!
